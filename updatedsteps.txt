2024-09-06 17:00:14,603 - INFO - 33. USDC -> V2(0.30%) -> WETH -> V3(0.05%) -> DAI -> V3(1.00%) -> WETH -> V3(0.30%) -> USDC

What im saying is these lines where it says we are going from USDC in a v2 pool to WETH in a v3 wont work on the network

If we are using the ethereum block chain we can only go from whatever pool were in 

Basically if we input a token and start the arbitrage in a 0.3%fee tier pool we have to get the output of that token from the same fee tier pool.

Example config

lets say the detection comes back and says theres a price difference in this config

onfiguration for USDC-WETH:

Lets say 

the v2 pool is 5% cheaper than the 0.3% uniswapv3 pool

we need to load up the  v2 pool

0xB4e16d0168e52d35CaCD2c6185b44281Ec28C9Dc

We can use either token to start the arbtirage but if we find the arbitrage is with USDC from detection we should start

with inputing 

024-09-06 17:05:43,931 - INFO - Token0: USDC (0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48)

but remember this is happening in this pool 

0xB4e16d0168e52d35CaCD2c6185b44281Ec28C9Dc

Then depending on which token we inputted and outputted 

If we inputted USDC we then would need to take the outputted WETH from this pool

but remember this is happening in this pool first

0xB4e16d0168e52d35CaCD2c6185b44281Ec28C9Dc

and use WETH as the input on the 0.3% pool on uniswapv3

0x8ad599c3A0ff1De082011EFDDc58f1908eb6e6D8

we would input

0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2

and output

0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48

The path goes as follows

the v2 pool is 5% cheaper than the 0.3% uniswapv3 pool

Load the v2 pool

Input 

USDC/;WETH

if we input USDC we have to Output WETH

WE then can take that outputted WETH to the 0.3% uv3 pool

into the uv3 pool and output USDC in that pool.

Path:

1: USDC -> WETH (V2) 

2:WETH->USDC(V3 /0.3%)

I need you to update my pathfinder script to do this exactly and print the paths exactly like this so i can see you understood

Path:

1: USDC -> WETH (V2) 

2:WETH->USDC(V3 /0.3%)

0x addresses of pools:

1:

a input token id:

b output token id:

2:

a input token id:

b output token id:

Remember the token0 and token1 are just the ids.




my issue with this code is that the entire thing is just pieces. Ive tested all of them and they all work seperately but now we need to refactor the entire system.

The #DATADETECTIONALGORITHM section loads my configurations from redis so that i can moniotr specific paths for arbitrage.

The execute whole thing pieces have allowed me to execute on tenderly with my flashloan solidity contract and actually get transaction to happen and get included into blocks live on ethereum.


Heres the problem.

What im now aware of with code . We have to be very specific with the way we pass through groups of data and how we have functions call other functions to interpret the data to do other things with in the most basic form of what that is. 

Basically now i need to pass the data detection objects through to all the pieces in the 
#LIQUIDITYVAULTSTOFUNDTHEPATHS


and make sure this function
def find_optimal_amount_for_arbitrage(path, min_amount, max_amount, step_size):
    """
    Finds the optimal input amount for an arbitrage path by simulating different amounts.
    """
    optimal_amount = min_amount
    max_profit = float('-inf')

    for amount in range(min_amount, max_amount + 1, step_size):
        logging.info(f"Simulating with input amount: {amount}")
        profit, profit_percentage = simulate_arbitrage_for_path(path, amount)

        if profit is not None and profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = profit
            optimal_amount = amount

    logging.info(f"Optimal amount: {optimal_amount} with maximum profit: {max_profit:.6f}")
    return optimal_amount, max_profit





Can pull from the vaults dynamically based on what the path has indenfitied to be profitable. 


basically when this profit is identified like this
Timestamp: 2024-09-06 20:41:11
Path:
1: USDC -> WETH (V3/0.05%)
2: WETH -> USDC (V2)
Input Amount: 1000.000000 USDC
Output Amount: 1001.491461 USDC
Profit: 1.491461 USDC
Profit %: 0.15%
--------------------------------



I need the bot to go to the tokens and pools function and try to pull the input token to start the path.

If we dont have the token to run the path i need you to add this logging 
"Initial token to run the path is not found or isn't working from tokens_and_pools fucntion"
This is critical because if the money isnt working dynamically with the paths we wont be able to route in real time.




The next integration i need is when the path is identified and calculated i need it to 
#EXECUTETHEWHOLETHING


and i need the objects defined in the execute arbitrage function to be refactored to pass through the exact configurations in the datadetectionalgo with the new setup. 


Basically this system is function in 3 central pieces

the datadetectionalgo
liquidityvaultsforpaths
executionthewholething

When ive run integrations of the entire thing before one of the issues ive had is understand when running the entire scaled integration it starts getting a lot hard to identify where the errors are. I need you to be very explicit with what the data detection algorithm is passing to the 
liquidityvaultsforpaths
executionthewholething


Basically the only thing the liquidity vauilts for paths and execute the whole thing should even be looking at are opportunities the 
datadetectionalgo

has defined as profitable.

That being said i need logging maybe in a sperate file of how the profitable opportunities are being calculated with the specific numbers
i also need the exact payload structure in the execute the whole thing

The execute the whole thing should be submitting transactions to the flashbots in A-Z order of the transactions
basically if the path looks like this
Path:
1: USDC -> WETH (V3/0.05%)
2: WETH -> USDC (V2)
Input Amount: 1000.000000 USDC
Output Amount: 1001.491461 USDC
Profit: 1.491461 USDC
Profit %: 0.15%
--------------------

from the data detection algorithm it then needs to try to find the 

optimal amount to run the path
Profit %: 0.15%

basically if we can make a profit on the path it needs to ask the question,
for what input amount can we make the make the most amount of profit.
for example if it runs two simulations 
1:
1: USDC -> WETH (V3/0.05%)
2: WETH -> USDC (V2)
Input Amount: 2000.000000 USDC
Output Amount: 2002.491461 USDC
Profit: 2.491461 USDC

--------------------
2:
1: USDC -> WETH (V3/0.05%)
2: WETH -> USDC (V2)
Input Amount: 1000.000000 USDC
Output Amount: 1001.491461 USDC
Profit: 1.491461 USDC

--------------------
if it comes back and says the path can execute with 2000 in stead of 1000 i need it to be sent to the execution with the specific amounts of 2000 instead of 1000
My main concern is our bottom line.
like how we can optimize making the most amount of profit more so than the % gain.
If we have to sacrifice % to make more profit im okay with that but we need to test this fully. 


Finally we need logging of the exact payload structures being sent to the flashbots.

I need to see the exact inputs and outputs being sent so we can debug that interaction.


Maybe do all these interactions in dedicated logging files for debugging?
Just for the main interactions between

why im doing this:


Now in order for the flashbots to work we need the payloads to be constructed like this
1:
1: USDC -> WETH (V3/0.05%)
2: WETH -> USDC (V2)
Input Amount: 2000.000000 USDC
Output Amount: 2002.491461 USDC
Profit: 2.491461 USDC


Well use this optimized path as an example to define exactly in the A-Z step the flashbots need to be able to execute the transactions
This is what a block of transactions looks like in sequential order:

1: Balancer flashloan USDC 2000
2: USDC -> WETH (V3/0.05%)
3: WETH -> USDC (V2)

Input Amount: 2000.000000 USDC
Output Amount: 2002.491461 USDC
4:Repay 2000USDC back to the balancer Vault
Profit: 2.491461 USDC
5:send profit back to my wallet

Once we have this e2e system working we will be able to make profits.

Why im working so hard on this:
I need  this pathing structure to be able to handle hundreds of millions of dollars with the bot basically so i start working on music. I promise that when you get this to work i will do everything i possibly can to change the world with music. I also promise that I will do it in the best way and most moralistic way that I know how. When i get this money im writing this down. 

the first thing i will do is pay my debts.
I will then start getting all the studio equipment i need 
Simulatenously while we are scripting i will be researching the best ways to start doing internet marketing.
