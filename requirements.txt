Working Docker compose file for running a local ethereum Node
Make sure all the ports are working 
https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/
Check the ports Here
Make sure your port is configured with the proper external address
Your node has to expose ports to connect to other peers. If its not connecting is because the ports are exposed properly

The docker compose file bridges the images properly
Sets up a docker Network that allows the execution client to see the consensus client

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step plan to create a high-value arbitrage system using flashloans on Uniswap V2 and V3, optimized for speed and efficiency:

Step 1: Set up Data Collection System

Implement WebSocket listeners for Uniswap V2 and V3 events
Store real-time pool data in Redis
Log historical data in a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB)

Tests:

Verify real-time update speed (should be <500ms)
Check data consistency between Redis and on-chain data
Ensure no event loss during high-volume periods

Step 2: Develop Pool Selection Algorithm

Analyze historical data to identify most active and profitable pairs
Implement dynamic pool selection based on liquidity and trading volume
Create a priority queue for pool monitoring

Tests:

Verify that selected pools cover >80% of total liquidity
Ensure dynamic updates as market conditions change
Check that priority queue correctly orders pools by potential profitability

Step 3: Implement Arbitrage Detection Algorithm

Develop a fast price comparison algorithm between V2 and V3 pools
Implement multi-hop opportunity detection (up to 3 hops)
Create a scoring system for opportunity ranking

Tests:

Benchmark algorithm speed (should process 1000+ pool comparisons per second)
Verify accuracy of price calculations against on-chain data
Ensure multi-hop opportunities are correctly identified and ranked

Step 4: Optimize Flashloan Integration

Implement Balancer flashloan contract integration
Develop optimal loan size calculation algorithm
Create a pre-flight check system to ensure profitability

Tests:

Verify flashloan execution speed (aim for <2 seconds from opportunity detection to execution)
Ensure 100% repayment rate on test transactions
Check that pre-flight checks correctly filter out unprofitable trades

Step 5: Develop Execution Engine

Implement parallel transaction submission for speed
Develop a gas price optimization algorithm
Create a transaction monitoring and confirmation system

Tests:

Measure execution speed (aim for <500ms from decision to transaction broadcast)
Verify that gas price optimization increases success rate without overpaying
Ensure robust handling of failed transactions

Step 6: Implement Risk Management System

Develop real-time profitability analysis
Implement circuit breakers for unusual market conditions
Create a dynamic position sizing algorithm

Tests:

Verify that circuit breakers trigger under simulated extreme conditions
Ensure position sizing adapts to changing market volatility
Check that profitability analysis accurately accounts for all costs

Step 7: Create Monitoring and Analytics Dashboard

Develop real-time performance monitoring
Implement historical analysis tools
Create alerts for system anomalies

Tests:

Verify dashboard update speed (aim for real-time updates)
Ensure accuracy of historical profit/loss calculations
Check that alerts trigger promptly for predefined conditions

Step 8: Optimize for High-Frequency Operation

Implement CPU and memory optimizations
Develop a load balancing system for handling multiple opportunities
Create a self-tuning system for performance parameters

Tests:

Benchmark system to handle 100+ opportunities per second
Verify stable operation under sustained high load
Ensure self-tuning improves performance over time

Step 9: Implement Advanced Routing Strategies

Develop pathfinding algorithm for complex arbitrage routes
Implement slippage prediction for multi-hop trades
Create a learning system to improve route selection over time

Tests:

Verify that pathfinding algorithm finds optimal routes in <100ms
Ensure slippage predictions are within 5% of actual slippage
Check that route selection improves profitability over time

Step 10: Continuous Integration and Deployment Pipeline

Set up automated testing for all components
Implement blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
Create a rollback system for quick recovery from issues

Tests:

Ensure 100% test coverage for critical components
Verify zero downtime during simulated deployments
Check that rollback completes in <1 minute

For each step, implement logging and error handling. After completing each step, run the system in a testnet environment for at least 24 hours before moving to the next step.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track:

Average time from opportunity detection to execution
Success rate of arbitrage transactions
Profit per trade and hourly/daily profit
System uptime and reliability
Gas costs as a percentage of profit
Number of profitable opportunities detected vs executed

By following this plan and rigorously testing at each stage, you'll build a robust, efficient, and profitable arbitrage system. Remember, the goal is not just to make profits, but to provide value to the ecosystem by improving price consistency and liquidity distribution across Uniswap V2 and V3 pools.






Define Your Services
You'll need to define Docker containers for the following services:

Ethereum Node: For blockchain interactions.
Price Monitor Service: For fetching and updating pool data.
Redis: For storing pool data.
Arbitrage Calculation Service: For calculating arbitrage opportunities.
Trade Execution Service: For executing trades on the blockchain.
