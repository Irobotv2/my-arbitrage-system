Liquidity pools 


Arbitrage System Improvement Plan
1: redisinsertion.py

Data Integrity and Accuracy

 Audit Redis data structure and content
 Implement data validation checks in redisinsertion.py
 Create a script to periodically update and verify pool data
 Develop unit tests for data retrieval and storage functions


Purpose: Populate Redis database with token and pool data
Key Functions:

Fetch top tokens from Etherscan
Retrieve token info and pool data for Uniswap V2 and V3
Store data in Redis for quick access





2. triggers.py

Purpose: Scan for arbitrage opportunities
Key Functions:

Check for price deviations across pools
Identify liquidity imbalances
Log potential arbitrage opportunities



Trigger Detection Enhancement

 Refactor price deviation detection algorithm
 Improve liquidity imbalance calculation
 Implement cross-version pool comparison (V2 vs V3)
 Add more sophisticated filters to reduce false positives


3. sendtochain.py

Purpose: Execute arbitrage transactions on-chain
Key Functions:

Simulate arbitrage paths
Execute transactions using flash loans
Calculate and report profits

Path Finding Optimization

 Implement or improve Dynamic DFS algorithm
 Optimize for multi-hop arbitrage opportunities
 Add heuristics to prioritize more profitable paths
 Implement path pruning to reduce computational overhead


Execution Refinement

 Enhance integration between trigger detection and execution scripts
 Implement real-time profitability checks before execution
 Add gas price considerations to profit calculations
 Develop a simulation mode for testing execution without real transactions


Testing and Monitoring

 Develop a comprehensive test suite for each component
 Implement logging and monitoring for each stage of the arbitrage process
 Create visualizations for arbitrage opportunities and executions
 Set up alerts for unusual activities or potential issues


Performance Optimization

 Profile each script to identify bottlenecks
 Optimize database queries and data processing
 Explore parallel processing for trigger scanning
 Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data


Documentation and Codebase Improvement

 Create detailed documentation for each script and major function
 Refactor code for better readability and maintainability
 Standardize error handling and logging across all scripts
 Implement config files for easy parameter tuning
