# Arbitrage Bot Development Checklist

## 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Set up a secure development environment
- [ ] Install all required dependencies (web3, flashbots, etc.)
- [ ] Configure proper logging and error handling

## 2. Token and Pool Configuration
- [ ] Create a configuration file for token addresses and pool information
- [ ] Implement functions to fetch and update token prices and pool liquidity

## 3. Price Calculation and Arbitrage Opportunity Detection
- [ ] Implement price calculation for Uniswap V2 and V3 pools
- [ ] Create a function to calculate price differences between pools
- [ ] Set up a system to continuously monitor price differences
- [ ] Implement arbitrage opportunity detection logic

## 4. Profit Calculation
- [ ] Implement a function to calculate potential profit for each arbitrage opportunity
- [ ] Account for gas costs, slippage, and other fees in profit calculations

## 5. Transaction Building
- [ ] Refactor the existing `execute_flashloan_and_bundle` function to be more modular
- [ ] Implement dynamic payload generation based on detected opportunities
- [ ] Create functions to estimate gas costs accurately

## 6. Risk Management
- [ ] Implement slippage protection mechanisms
- [ ] Add transaction size limits and other safety checks

## 7. Execution Strategy
- [ ] Implement logic to determine optimal execution timing
- [ ] Create a queuing system for multiple arbitrage opportunities

## 8. Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] Set up real-time monitoring of bot performance
- [ ] Implement an alerting system for errors, unusual profits/losses, or other important events

## 9. Testing
- [ ] Develop comprehensive unit tests for each component
- [ ] Implement integration tests for the entire system
- [ ] Perform thorough testing on the Sepolia testnet

## 10. Optimization
- [ ] Optimize code for speed and efficiency
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for faster opportunity detection

## 11. Security
- [ ] Conduct a security audit of the code
- [ ] Implement secure key management (remove hardcoded private keys)

## 12. Documentation
- [ ] Write detailed documentation for each component of the bot
- [ ] Create a user guide for operation and maintenance

## 13. Deployment
- [ ] Set up a robust deployment process
- [ ] Configure monitoring and logging for the production environment

## 14. Maintenance Plan
- [ ] Establish a process for regular updates and maintenance
- [ ] Create a plan for handling network upgrades or changes in DEX protocols

## Price Calculation and Pool Comparison

To properly calculate and compare prices between pools:

1. For Uniswap V2 pools:
   - Use the formula: price = reserveOut / reserveIn
   - Fetch reserves using the `getReserves()` function on the pair contract

2. For Uniswap V3 pools:
   - Use the square root price (sqrtPriceX96) from the pool
   - Convert sqrtPriceX96 to price using: price = (sqrtPriceX96 / 2^96)^2

3. Compare prices:
   - Calculate the price difference: diff = (price1 - price2) / price2
   - Consider an arbitrage opportunity if the difference exceeds your threshold (e.g., 1%)

4. Account for fees and slippage:
   - Include the pool fees (0.3% for V2, variable for V3) in your calculations
   - Estimate slippage based on trade size and pool liquidity

5. Implement continuous monitoring:
   - Set up a loop to frequently check prices (e.g., every block or every few seconds)
   - Use WebSocket connections for real-time updates when possible

Remember to always test thoroughly and start with small trade sizes when moving to mainnet.
