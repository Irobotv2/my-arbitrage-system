# Ethereum Multi-Pair Arbitrage Bot

This project implements an advanced arbitrage detection and execution system for Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges, focusing on Uniswap V2 and V3 pools. It's designed for detailed diagnostic analysis and automated arbitrage execution.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of Uniswap V2 and V3 pools
- Dynamic arbitrage opportunity detection across multiple token pairs
- Flashloan-powered arbitrage execution using Balancer V2
- Automated execution of profitable trades via Flashbots and multiple MEV builders
- Detailed performance reporting and logging
- Configurable thresholds for opportunity detection and execution
- Liquidity checks to ensure viable trade execution
- Gas cost and slippage considerations in profit calculations

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Web3.py
- Redis
- Ethereum node with HTTP and WebSocket support
- Access to Flashbots and other MEV builder APIs

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

cd my-arbitrage-system
Copy
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy
3. Configure your Ethereum nodes:
- Set up a local node for data querying
- Configure a node for transaction execution (e.g., Tenderly RPC)

4. Set up Redis and update the connection details in the script.

5. Update the `wallet_address` and `private_key` constants with your Ethereum wallet information.

6. Configure the `builder_urls` list with the MEV builder endpoints you want to use.

## Usage

Run the main script:
python allconfigs.py
Copy
The script will start monitoring configured pools, detect arbitrage opportunities, and execute profitable trades using flashloans when possible. It runs for a specified duration (default 2 minutes) and generates a detailed report at the end.

## Configuration

- `DETECTION_THRESHOLD`: Minimum profit percentage to log an opportunity
- `EXECUTION_THRESHOLD`: Minimum profit percentage to execute an arbitrage
- `MIN_LIQUIDITY_THRESHOLD_ETH`: Minimum liquidity required in a pool for consideration
- `GAS_PRICE` and `GAS_LIMIT`: Parameters for gas cost estimation
- `FLASH_LOAN_FEE`: Fee percentage for flash loans

## Logging

The script uses a comprehensive logging system with separate loggers for:
- Main operations
- Submitted transactions
- Confirmed transactions

Logs are rotated to manage file sizes effectively.

## Report Generation

After each run, the script generates a detailed report including:
- Total opportunities detected
- Analysis of top opportunities
- Detailed breakdowns of price calculations, liquidity, and potential issues

## Smart Contracts

The project interacts with several smart contracts:
- Uniswap V2 and V3 pools and routers
- A custom FlashLoanBundleExecutor for executing arbitrage trades
